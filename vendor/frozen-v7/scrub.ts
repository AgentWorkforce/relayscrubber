 * ends within it, is redacted the same way from rule set 5 (rule set 4 redacted it as

 * rule set 5 classified its first `MAX_QUOTED_VALUE` units, so 4096 digits then a tail
 * passed as a number and the tail was kept): one of `MAX_QUOTED_VALUE` units or more is
 * redacted whole, whatever it holds; a shorter one is kept when it is a JSON literal, a
 * number or not generated-looking.
 *
 * Linear: one forward walk per value from its start finds the close, whether a line
 * break precedes it, and the bound together; the walk ends at the next quote of the
 * value's own kind (quote and backslash depth), which every later value of that kind opens
 * with, so the walks of one kind never overlap; past the bound the walk goes on to the
 * close or the end, and a value with no close runs to the end; the redaction consumes
 * what was walked. With `overCap`, the span [key start, value end) of
 * each over-long quoted value and of each generated unquoted value of `MAX_QUOTED_VALUE`
 * units or more is recorded; with `multiLine` too, so is that of each quoted value within

/**
 * Truncate over-long input BEFORE the patterns run, cutting only after whitespace.

 * Cutting mid-token would leave the leading fragment of a credential in the retained
 * prefix — short enough that no `{20,}`-style pattern matches it, so the scrubber would
 * silently stop protecting the very thing it exists to protect. Apart from the PEM rule,
 * no rule's match contains whitespace except as a separator before the secret (Bearer,
 * `key = value`), as a delimiter before it (home paths), or between the digit groups of
 * a card or phone number. So the cut falls only right after whitespace and never
 * between two digit groups (a digit or `)` before the whitespace, a digit or `(` after
 * it), which leaves every secret either wholly retained (and therefore scrubbed) or
 * wholly dropped.
 *
 * The cut therefore rewinds to the last whitespace before the limit however far back
 * that is. An input with no whitespace at all is one unbroken run (minified JSON, a
 * base64 dump) and is dropped whole rather than cut inside, because a credential can
 * sit anywhere in such a run. Cuts after whitespace never split a surrogate pair, since
 * every JavaScript whitespace character is in the BMP.
 *
 * A private key is the one multi-line secret: the PEM rule needs both delimiters, so a
 * block whose footer falls past the cut is withheld from its header on.
 *
 * The truncation is always announced in band so a reader can tell a truncated record
 * from a short one.
